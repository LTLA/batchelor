Description: 
    Implements a variety of methods for batch correction of single-cell (RNA sequencing) data. 
    This includes methods based on detecting mutually nearest neighbors,
    as well as several efficient variants of linear regression of the log-expression values.
    Functions are also provided to perform global rescaling to remove differences in depth between batches,
    and to perform a principal components analysis that is robust to differences in the numbers of cells across batches.
