Description: 
    Implements a variety of methods for batch correction of single-cell (RNA sequencing) data. 
    This includes methods based on detecting mutually nearest neighbors,
    as well as a simple sparsity-preserving translation of the population means. 
    Functions are also provided for global rescaling to remove differences in depth between batches, 
    and to perform a principal components analysis that is robust to differences in the numbers of cells across batches.
